# Overview

## The Challenge:
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

## User Story

```md
AS a person who wants planned meals
I WANT to be able input my diet information and choose certain ingredients
SO THAT I can get a meal plan for dinner.
And to be able to get a random cocktail to quench said thirst.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
